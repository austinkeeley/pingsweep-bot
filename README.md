pingsweep-bot
===============

This is an errbot plugin that runs nmap to do a ping sweep of
your network.

Edit the subnet in `pingsweep.py`. Additionally if you want additional info about the devices on the network, you
will need to run with `sudo` rights by toggling the `SUDO` boolean.

To use, run `!pingsweep`.
